Ghost assignment by Jerry Liao, teacher at stanCode.

Description:
This program was developed as part of the SC101 course to simulate a basic version of
a photo-cleaning app that removes photobombers from scenic images. My main contribution
includes completing all core functions—`get_pixel_dist`, `get_average`, `get_best_pixel`,
and `solve`. These functions work together to calculate the color distance of each pixel
across multiple images, find the average RGB value at each coordinate, and select the
best pixel (i.e., the one least affected by random passersby) to reconstruct a clean,
composite image.

Through this project, I practiced manipulating lists and images in Python, applied
mathematical concepts like Euclidean distance in RGB space, and learned how to extend
and complete partially written code—skills critical for real-world software development.
