------------------------------
This program calculates a score for a given string based on
the types of characters it contains:

- Digits contribute 1 point each
- Uppercase letters contribute 2 points each
- Lowercase letters contribute 3 points each

This script demonstrates control flow, character classification,
and loop-based accumulation â€” common in string preprocessing
and feature engineering for data science tasks.


It assigns points as follows:
digits are worth 1 point, uppercase letters are worth 2 points, 
and lowercase letters are worth 3 points. The score() function 
goes through each character in the string, adds up the points 
according to its type, and then prints out the total score.
