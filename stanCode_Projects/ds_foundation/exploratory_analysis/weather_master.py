This program collects a series of daily temperature readings
from the user, then reports summary statistics:

- Highest temperature
- Lowest temperature
- Average temperature
- Count of cold days (temperature below 16Â°C)

This program demonstrates fundamental data processing logic
used in data science: accumulation, conditional evaluation,
and summary statistics aggregation.
