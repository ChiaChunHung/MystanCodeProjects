------------------------
This program checks whether a given integer is a
narcissistic number.

A narcissistic number is a positive integer equal to the sum
of its digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.
All single-digit numbers are considered narcissistic.

The program repeatedly accepts input until the user enters
a sentinel value to exit. This exercise reinforces digit
manipulation, exponentiation, and loop control.

    whether the number is a narcissistic number, by counting the number of the digit of it,
    calculating the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits,
    and comparing the sum with the number itself.
