Description:
Completed as part of SC101 Assignment 1. I implemented the core logic for distinguishing
odd/even mouse clicks to draw circles and lines, and managed user click tracking with
global variables. This task helped strengthen my understanding of event handling and
graphical programming using campy.

from campy.gui.events.mouse import onmouseclicked

# Constant controls the radius of the circle
SIZE = 5

# Global variables
window = GWindow()  # create a canvas window
times_of_click = 0  # count mouse clicks to determine odd/even
odd_clicks_x = 0    # store x coordinate of the first odd click
odd_clicks_y = 0    # store y coordinate of the first off click


def main():
    """
    This program creates lines on an instance of GWindow class.
    There is a circle indicating the userâ€™s first click. A line appears
    at the condition where the circle disappears as the user clicks
    on the canvas for the second time.
